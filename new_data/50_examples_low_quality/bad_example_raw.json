Ideally we want to have a whole set of action shortcuts for navigating around the admin like press `n` when not in a content editable field to make a new post.\\n\\nIt would also be good to have `esc` cause all modals, popovers, notifications, etc to close.\\n\\nWe also need to overhaul the existing shortcuts to make them not clash with foreign characters in various locales, see #1463 for the epic which links to most of the existing bugs.\\n\\nBecause we want to have to many different types of shortcut, we need to have a holistic approach to implementing them. We need to decide on if we want to use a tool or library to help us, if there is a truly \\Ember\\\" way to do this, and what it ought to look like - do the markdown shortcuts need to live elsewhere to the navigation ones, etc?\\n\\nSee this [comment](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/issues/2752#issuecomment-45213684) for details of what the outcome from this issue should be.\\n\"",
